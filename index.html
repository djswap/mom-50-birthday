          She cared for us when we were sick, stayed up late with worry in her eyes, celebrated every win, and stood strong through every loss. When we were unwell, she would quietly pray, asking God to take our pain and give it to her instead.
          <br><br>
          She cared for her parents, her in-laws, and everyone who needed her — endlessly, selflessly, and without hesitation.
